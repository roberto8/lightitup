Who we are, what it is!
Light it up is a project that started with Erasmus+, and as kept growing ever since! It is mainly an arduino project, even though we are implementing a raspberry pi as an hub! soo the code is mainly written in C or python. If you are a develloper and wan't to get in with us on this big adventure enrole: http://eepurl.com/cd3Et5

you can download our app at our website: http://lightitup.pancakeapps.com

You can easly acces all the code in here since we only have arduino and raspberry pi(sketch) code here!

Thank you!
